I believe you don't know what you really wanna know:  
If I leave right now, would I let you follow?  
Do you wanna know how it feels to be complete?  
I guess you'll find out if you come with me

and I’ll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,  
and I will see you tomorrow morn’".

Then when you've seen the sun  
and when all is said and done  
I find out you're no Daphne.  
I'll look for more sweet bay  
but still I guess another day  
I'll wake up with an oak tree.

When the logging's over then I'll finally get some peace,  
but come on, we all know that I am no Artemis.  
She hunts on her own I hunt someone who's alone.  
She brings her arrows, I bring more cologne.

And I'll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,  
and I will see you tomorrow morn.  
And by then you'll have to wallow  
because you only got to to borrow me".

Then when you've seen the sun  
and when all is said and done  
I find out you're no Daphne.  
I'll look for more sweet bay  
but still I guess another day  
I'll wake up with an oak tree.

<p class="lyric">I believe you don't know what you really wanna know:</p>

`(G)  C             D   Dsus4/A   G`

*If I leave right now, would I let you follow?*

`(G)     C                G`

*Do you wanna know how it feels to be complete?*

`(G)          C            D  Dsus4/A  G`

*I guess you'll find out if you come with me*
<br><br>

`            G      C/G  G`

*and I’ll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,*

`         G       C/G      G Dsus4/A G/H`

*and I will see you tomorrow morn’.”*
<br><br>

`     C          G    D   C`

*Then when you've seen the sun*

`           D Dsus4/A  G` 

*and when all is said and done*

`D/F# Em7 /B C Am7 D G`

*I find out you're no Daphne.*

`(G)             D    C`

*I'll look for more sweet bay*

`         D Dsus4/A  G`

*but still I guess another day*

`D/F# Em7 /B C  Am7 D  G`

*I'll wake up with an oak tree.*
<br><br>

`G                 C           G`

*When the logging's over then I'll finally get some peace,*

`G           C              D   Dsus4/A   G`

*but come on, we all know that I am no Artemis.*

`(G)       C               G`

*She hunts on her own I hunt someone who's alone.*

`(G)           C            D  Dsus4/A  G`

*She brings her arrows, I bring more cologne.*
<br><br>

`            G      C/G  G`

*And I'll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,*

`          G      C/G  G`

*and I will see you tomorrow morn’.”*

`            G            C/G  G`

*And by then you'll have to wallow*

`            G            C/G   G`

*because you only got to to borrow me".*
<br><br>

`     C           G    D   C`

*Then when you've seen the sun*

`            D Dsus4/A  G` 

*and when all is said and done*

`D/F# Em7 /B C Am7 D G`

*I find out you're no Daphne.*

`(G)             D     C`

*I'll look for more sweet bay*

`         D Dsus4/A  G`

*but still I guess another day*

`D/F# Em7 /B C  Am7 D   G`

*I'll wake up with an oak tree.*

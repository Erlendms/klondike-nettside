```

`G           C                   G`

*I believe you don't know what you really wanna know:*

`(G)  C             D   Dsus4/A   G`

_If I leave right now, would I let you follow?_

`(G)     C                G`

_Do you wanna know how it feels to be complete?_

`(G)          C            D  Dsus4/A  G`

_I guess you'll find out if you come with me_
<br><br>

`            G      C/G  G`

_and I’ll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,_

`         G       C/G      G Dsus4/A G/H`

_and I will see you tomorrow morn’.”_
<br><br>

`     C          G    D   C`

_Then when you've seen the sun_

`           D Dsus4/A  G`

_and when all is said and done_

`D/F# Em7 /B C Am7 D G`

_I find out you're no Daphne._

`(G)             D    C`

_I'll look for more sweet bay_

`         D Dsus4/A  G`

_but still I guess another day_

`D/F# Em7 /B C  Am7 D  G`

_I'll wake up with an oak tree._
<br><br>

`G                 C           G`

_When the logging's over then I'll finally get some peace,_

`G           C              D   Dsus4/A   G`

_but come on, we all know that I am no Artemis._

`(G)       C               G`

_She hunts on her own I hunt someone who's alone._

`(G)           C            D  Dsus4/A  G`

_She brings her arrows, I bring more cologne._
<br><br>

`            G      C/G  G`

_And I'll say "Hey, I'm Apollo,_

`          G      C/G  G`

_and I will see you tomorrow morn’.”_

`            G            C/G  G`

_And by then you'll have to wallow_

`            G            C/G   G`

_because you only got to to borrow me"._
<br><br>

`     C           G    D   C`

_Then when you've seen the sun_

`            D Dsus4/A  G`

_and when all is said and done_

`D/F# Em7 /B C Am7 D G`

_I find out you're no Daphne._

`(G)             D     C`

_I'll look for more sweet bay_

`         D Dsus4/A  G`

_but still I guess another day_

`D/F# Em7 /B C  Am7 D   G`

_I'll wake up with an oak tree._

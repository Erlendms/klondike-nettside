She knows I’m not that brave</br>
and cry when Frodo leaves.</br>
She's why I got this flat</br>
that’s way too big for the two of us</br>

However, now she’s gone</br>
but you smile at everything.</br>
You’ve seen them come and go before.</br>

It’s quiet for awhile.</br>
You light a cigarette.</br>
Even from afar</br>
you know my thoughts by their silhouettes,</br>

so we don’t have to talk.</br>
For now a beer’s enough</br>
to make the rain seem far away.</br>

The brother of my heart</br>
lives in you, I know</br>
as long as they beat</br>
I will always have a safe retreat.</br>
‘Cause brotherhood’s an art</br>
and we paint when we fall</br>
and on this canvas</br>
colors are painted on once and for all.</br>

You say I’ve put on weight.</br>
I say you’ve lost some hair</br>
since nineteen-ninty-eight</br>
when we dreamt of France in the summer air</br>

Suddenly I’m back to when</br>
I smiled at everything</br>
and got my first can of paint and learned</br>

(that) the brother of my heart</br>
lives in you, and I know</br>
as long as they beat</br>
I will always have a safe retreat.</br>
‘Cause brotherhood’s an art</br>
and we paint when we fall</br>
and on this canvas</br>
colors are painted on once and for all.</br>

I build these castles made of sand</br>
again and again and think that they will do,</br>
but start anew</br>
with less sand than I had before,</br>
and one more time I loose it to the shore.</br>
It’s a state of war.</br>

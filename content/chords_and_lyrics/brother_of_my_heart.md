She knows I’m not that brave
and cry when Frodo leaves.
She's why I got this flat
that’s way too big for the two of us

However, now she’s gone
but you smile at everything.
You’ve seen them come and go before.

It’s quiet for awhile.
You light a cigarette.
Even from afar
you know my thoughts by their silhouettes,

so we don’t have to talk.
For now a beer’s enough
to make the rain seem far away.

The brother of my heart
lives in you, I know
as long as they beat I will always have a safe retreat.
‘Cause brotherhood’s an art
and we paint when we fall
and on this canvas colors are painted on once and for all  

You say I’ve put on weight.
I say you’ve lost some hair
since nineteen-ninty-eight
when we dreamt of France in the summer air

Suddenly I’m back to when
I smiled at everything
and got my first can of paint and learned

(that) the brother of my heart                         
lives in you, and I know
as long as they beat I will always have a safe retreat.                 
‘Cause brotherhood’s an art                 
and we paint when we fall
and on this canvas colors are painted on once and for all

I build these castles made of sand
again and again and think that they will do,
but start anew
with less sand than I had before 
and one more time I loose it to the shore
it’s a state of war

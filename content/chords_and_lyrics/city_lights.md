I can’t stop thinking of the power</br>
of happy hour a friday night</br>
And I don’t care about the weather</br>
as I remember you said “all right”</br>

when I asked you to stay</br>
in our hideaway.</br>
And as I’m walking home in the rain</br>
still your scent remains</br>

City lights, city lights</br>
keep me company on my way home.</br>
(I) saw the light, in the night.</br>
I no longer wanna be on my own.</br>

Tomorrow morning I will call to</br>
make sure I know you will meet again.</br>
You’ll stay until the morning after.</br>
Kisses and laughter as we begin.</br>

Will you be part of my past?</br>
Will we move to fast?</br>
So many questions spinning around</br>
as I’m downtown bound</br>

City lights, city lights</br>
keep me company on my way home.</br>
(I) saw the light, in the night.</br>
I no longer wanna be on my own</br>

Where do we go from our beginning?</br>
How do we know if we should try?</br>
When I'm with you, feels like I'm living</br>
I never wanna loose this high</br>

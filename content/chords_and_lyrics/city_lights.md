I can’t stop thinking of the power
of happy hour a friday night
And I don’t care about the weather
as I remember you said “all right”

when I asked you to stay
in our hideaway.
And as I’m walking home in the rain
still your scent remains

City lights, city lights
keep me company on my way home.
(I) saw the light, in the night.
I no longer wanna be on my own. 

Tomorrow morning I will call to
make sure I know you will meet again.
You’ll stay until the morning after.
Kisses and laughter as we begin.

Will you be part of my past?
Will we move to fast?
So many questions spinning around
as I’m downtown bound

City lights, city lights
keep me company on my way home.
(I) saw the light, in the night.
I no longer wanna be on my own

Where do we go from our beginning?
How do we know if we should try?
When I'm with you, feels like I'm living 
I never wanna loose this high

Another midnight and we’re dancing,</br>
but it’s alright - I know we just play around.</br>
My friends say «Avoid her. It is over.»</br>
I’m a soldier - this floor is a battleground.</br>

I hate the feeling when I hear you say</br>
that you want me to look away.</br>
Like a deer in the headlight I am dancing</br>
as an air strike - you’re kissing another guy.</br>

I’ve been picking all of these battles,</br>
and I know I’m out of control.</br>
I’ve been thinking about all the scandals</br>
as I’m drinking on my own.</br>
I’ve been checking out all these dancers,</br>
and there’s no on just like you.</br>
and I’m looking to you for the answers,</br>
even though we’re through.</br>

I look at a screen with nothing.</br>
And I don’t really know if I’ll sleep at all.</br>
I just feel like screaming something,</br>
but I know, it’s my demon’s curtain call.</br>

I never wanna find another</br>
prima donna - that makes me forget that I</br>
once was a fighter flying higher.</br>
But, my desire accepts that I don’t know why</br>

I’ve been picking all of these battles,</br>
and I know I’m out of control.</br>
I’ve been thinking about all the scandals</br>
as I’m drinking on my own.</br>
I’ve been checking out all these dancers,</br>
and there’s no on just like you.</br>
and I’m looking to you for the answers,</br>
even though we’re through.</br>

I wake up to empty bottles,</br>
and I don’t wanna know if I drank it all.</br>
I wake up to empty bottles,</br>
and I know, it’s my demon’s curtain call.</br>
Everyone said we belong together.</br>

//:I don’t wanna think about you, I don’t wanna know.

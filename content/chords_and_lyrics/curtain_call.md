Another midnight and we’re dancing,
but it’s alright - I know we just play around.
My friends say «Avoid her. It is over.»
I’m a soldier - this floor is a battleground.

I hate the feeling when I hear you say
that you want me to look away.
Like a deer in the headlight I am dancing
as an air strike - you’re kissing another guy.

I’ve been picking all of these battles,
and I know I’m out of control.
I’ve been thinking about all the scandals
as I’m drinking on my own.
I’ve been checking out all these dancers,
and there’s no on just like you.
and I’m looking to you for the answers,
even though we’re through.

I look at a screen with nothing.
And I don’t really know if I’ll sleep at all.
I just feel like screaming something,
but I know, it’s my demon’s curtain call.

I never wanna find another
prima donna - that makes me forget that I
once was a fighter flying higher.
But, my desire accepts that I don’t know why

I’ve been picking all of these battles,
and I know I’m out of control.
I’ve been thinking about all the scandals
as I’m drinking on my own.
I’ve been checking out all these dancers,
and there’s no on just like you.
and I’m looking to you for the answers,
even though we’re through.

I wake up to empty bottles,
and I don’t wanna know if I drank it all.
I wake up to empty bottles,
and I know, it’s my demon’s curtain call.
Everyone said we belong together

//:I don’t wanna think about you, I don’t wanna know.

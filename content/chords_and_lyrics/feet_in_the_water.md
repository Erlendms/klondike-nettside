You told me long ago,
that you would never call me yours.
Still I wanna be the first to cross your mind 
when you're afraid, alone or bored of weekdays.

If there is no tomorrow 
for the two of us, then why,
why do you call to talk about your morning?
Why do you make me feel like I still matter.

I got my feet in the water -
longing for a day where I can leave the shore and dive in headfirst.
I got my feet in the water. 
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts, but still my hope remains
I guess the greatest of these is hope.

When you ask I tell you
I don’t need more than you’re giving me.
But I wanna soak myself in what we could be.
I wanna swim in all the little moments we could have.

I got my feet in the water
longing for a day where I can leave the shore and dive in headfirst.
I got my feet in the water, 
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts, but still my hope remains.
I guess the greatest of these is hope.

I got my feet in the water
why don’t you just end us now if this ain’t happening anyway?

I got my feet in the water
I need your help, to drag me out, 
please just let me dry off and be done.
I got my feet in the water
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts, but still my hope remains.
I guess the greatest of these is hope.

You told me long ago,</br>
that you would never call me yours.</br>
Still I wanna be the first to cross your mind</br>
when you're afraid, alone or bored of weekdays.</br>

If there is no tomorrow</br>
for the two of us, then why,</br>
why do you call to talk about your morning?</br>
Why do you make me feel like I still matter.</br>

I got my feet in the water</br>
\- longing for a day where I can</br>
leave the shore and dive in headfirst.</br>
I got my feet in the water. 
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts,</br>
but still my hope remains.</br>
I guess the greatest of these is hope.</br>

When you ask I tell you</br>
I don’t need more than you’re giving me.</br>
But I wanna soak myself in what we could be.</br>
I wanna swim in all the little moments we could have.</br>

I got my feet in the water</br>
\- longing for a day where I can</br>
leave the shore and dive in headfirst.</br>
I got my feet in the water, </br>
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts,</br>
but still my hope remains.</br>
I guess the greatest of these is hope.</br>

I got my feet in the water</br>
why don’t you just end us now,</br>
if this ain’t happening anyway?</br>

I got my feet in the water</br>
I need your help, to drag me out, </br>
please just let me dry off and be done.</br>
I got my feet in the water</br>
(All) faith is gone, and love just hurts,</br>
but still my hope remains.</br>
I guess the greatest of these is hope.</br>

I covered the ocean wide</br>
to make you mine.</br>
Everything cast aside</br>
to give us a try.</br>
I coloured your darkness bright -</br>
I gave you my all.</br>
You shined in the limelight</br>
and I enjoyed the show.</br>

Youâ€™re the reason my heartâ€™s on fire,</br>
but, Iâ€™m all burned out and oh so tired.</br>
And I should walk away, I should have let go.</br>
When the heart wanna stay,</br>
and the headâ€™s screaming "No!",</br>
Iâ€™m a firefighter.</br>

You gave me a notion I</br>
could justify.</br>
(I) Kept pouring the potion while</br>
I lived your lie.</br>
And if my devotion dies,</br>
you reignite</br>
my burning of daylight -</br>
still keeping me around.</br>

Youâ€™re the reason my heartâ€™s on fire,</br>
but, Iâ€™m all burned out and oh so tired.</br>
And I should walk away, I should have let go.</br>
When the heart wanna stay,</br>
and the headâ€™s screaming "No!",</br>
Iâ€™m a firefighter.</br>

#### Secret ending ðŸ¤« :

While you left a trace,</br>
itâ€™s nothing I canâ€™t erase.</br>
Iâ€™m out of the maze,</br>
someplace.</br>

As I fly away,</br>
I know I will be OK</br>
\- â€˜cause out of the flames,</br>
comes a new day.</br>

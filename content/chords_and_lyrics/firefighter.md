I covered the ocean wide
to make you mine.
Everything cast aside
to give us a try.
I coloured your darkness bright -
I gave you my all.
You shined in the limelight
and I enjoyed the show.

You’re the reason my heart’s on fire,
but, I’m all burned out and oh so tired.
And I should walk away, I should have let go.
When the heart wanna stay, and the head’s screaming no,
I’m a firefighter.

You gave me a notion I
could justify.
(I) Kept pouring the potion while
I lived your lie.
And if my devotion dies,
you reignite
my burning of daylight -
still keeping me around.

You’re the reason my heart’s on fire,
but, I’m all burned out and oh so tired.
And I should walk away, I should have let go.
When the heart wanna stay, and the head’s screaming no,
I’m a firefighter.

#### Secret ending:

While you left a trace,
it’s nothing I can’t erase.
I’m out of the maze,
someplace.

As I fly away,
I know I will be OK -
‘cause out of the flames,
comes a new day.

Lately, when I wake up in the morning,
when I  -  wake up in the morning,
I’m always stalling - to keep me from falling. from falling.
I’m hiding in smiles and “good morning”.
I’m fading, adoring the taste of your warnings.

And I try to belong in the comfort of my solitude - that’s my excuse.
But you know that, yeah you know that what I’m drinking
gives away that I am sinking,
and I feel you know I’m thinking of the way I used to be.

How long, how long
will I need a healing?
I know, I know
I’m hard to believe in.

Let me hate me, I’ve used all your worry
and ways to tell you I’m sorry.
So sorry our story got caught in this stormy
weather that’s raging, that’s raging inside me.

And I try to belong in the comfort of my solitude - that’s my excuse.
But you know that, yeah you know that what I’m drinking
gives away that I am sinking,
and I feel you know I’m thinking of the way I used to be.

How long, how long
will I need a healing?
I know, I know
I’m hard to believe in.

Lately, when I wake up in the morning,</br>
when I wake up in the morning,</br>
I’m always stalling -</br>
to keep me from falling. from falling.</br>
I’m hiding in smiles and “good morning”.</br>
I’m fading, adoring the taste of your warnings.</br>

And I try to belong</br>
in the comfort of my solitude</br>
\- that’s my excuse.</br>
But you know that,</br>
yeah you know that what I’m drinking</br>
gives away that I am sinking,</br>
and I feel you know I’m thinking</br>
of the way I used to be.</br>

How long, how long</br>
will I need a healing?</br>
I know, I know</br>
I’m hard to believe in.</br>

Let me hate me, I’ve used all your worry</br>
and ways to tell you I’m sorry.</br>
So sorry our story</br>
got caught in this stormy</br>
weather that’s raging,</br>
that’s raging inside me.</br>

And I try to belong</br>
in the comfort of my solitude</br>
\- that’s my excuse.</br>
But you know that,</br>
yeah you know that what I’m drinking</br>
gives away that I am sinking,</br>
and I feel you know I’m thinking</br>
of the way I used to be.</br>

How long, how long</br>
will I need a healing?</br>
I know, I know</br>
I’m hard to believe in.</br>

Everything I like to,</br>
everything that I tried to,</br>
anything I might do.</br>

Everyone I lied to,</br>
faking that I’m like you</br>
\- lost the guy that I knew.</br>

(But) just because it’s on repeat it</br>
doesn’t mean that I can’t beat it.</br>
And this time, I really feel it:</br>
I (wanna)</br>

Lose it </br>
I might as well do it, I regret the sorrow.</br>
I’m stepping over to the other side.</br>
I gotta lose it</br>
I might as well do shit I’ll regret tomorrow.</br>
So stepping over to the other side</br>
I’m gonna lose it.</br>

Everything I’m tied to,</br>
kings that I abide to</br>
\- (and) I just let it slide through.</br>

Saturdays are too few.</br>
Fashionista, who knew</br>
grey is now the new blue?</br>

Just because it’s on repeat it</br>
doesn’t mean that I can’t beat it.</br>
And this time, I really feel it:</br>
I (wanna)</br>

Lose it </br>
I might as well do it, I regret the sorrow.</br>
I’m stepping over to the other side</br>
I gotta lose it</br>
I might as well do shit I’ll regret tomorrow.</br>
So stepping over to the other side</br>
I’m gonna lose it.</br>

Drinkin’ on a Thursday,</br>
everyday's a birthday (yeah).</br>
Feeling like i’m first rate, yeah.</br>

(Drinkin’ on a Thursday,</br>
baby I’m an earthquake (yeah).</br>
Bumpin’ up the birthrate, yeah.)</br>

Everything I like to,
everything that I tried to,
anything I might do.

Everyone I lied to,
faking that I’m like you -
lost the guy that I knew.

(But) just because it’s on repeat it
doesn’t mean that I can’t beat it.
And this time, I really feel it:
I (wanna)

Lose it 
I might as well do it, I regret the sorrow.
I’m stepping over to the other side.
I gotta lose it
I might as well do shit I’ll regret tomorrow.
So stepping over to the other side
I’m gonna lose it

Everything I’m tied to,
kings that I abide to -
(And) I just let it slide through.

Saturdays are too few.
Fashionista, who knew
grey is now the new blue?

Just because it’s on repeat it
doesn’t mean that I can’t beat it.
And this time, I really feel it:
I (wanna)

Lose it 
I might as well do it, I regret the sorrow.
I’m stepping over to the other side
I gotta lose it
I might as well do shit I’ll regret tomorrow.
So stepping over to the other side
I’m gonna lose it

Drinkin’ on a Thursday,
everyday's a birthday (yeah).
Feeling like i’m first rate, yeah.

(Drinkin’ on a Thursday,
baby I’m an earthquake (yeah).
Bumpin’ up the birthrate, yeah.)

You told me years ago: you were the one for me.
I thought eventually, I would get on my knee, so I tried
to be all that I thought you would need, but I
don’t understand your plan
with your petty accusations and jealousy.
I hope that we can work it out.

Shot down with my heart in my hand.
I don’t understand why you stick around. 
My hometown’s got your face all around
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.

You chose the time and place; I knew what you had in mind.
You tried to hide your smile, and said that you hope I’d find someone else
to keep me company while you are all over town
in search of who you are.
And you said it with no tears in your pretty eyes.
You still looked fine walking out.

Shot down with my heart in my hand.
I don’t understand why you stick around. 
My hometown’s got your face all around
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.

I hope you’re happy now - he looks a lot like me.
Even though he only cares while you are on your knees. 
Later on, when you’re looking at your phone and got no replies,
I’m not the one to call.
You’re just a pretty decoration that catch their eye,
and just like me, they’re all moving on.

Shot down with your heart in your hand.
I don’t understand why you stick around. 
Your hometown’s got my face all around.
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.

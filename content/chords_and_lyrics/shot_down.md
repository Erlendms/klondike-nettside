You told me years ago: you were the one for me.</br>
I thought eventually,</br>
I would get on my knee,</br>
so I tried to be all</br>
that I thought you would need, but I</br>
don’t understand your plan</br>
with your petty accusations and jealousy.</br>
I hope that we can work it out.</br>

Shot down with my heart in my hand.</br>
I don’t understand why you stick around.</br>
My hometown’s got your face all around</br>
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.</br>

You chose the time and place;</br>
I knew what you had in mind.</br>
You tried to hide your smile,</br>
and said that you hope I’d find someone else</br>
to keep me company while you are all over town</br>
in search of who you are.</br>
And you said it with no tears in your pretty eyes.</br>
You still looked fine walking out.</br>

Shot down with my heart in my hand.</br>
I don’t understand why you stick around.</br> 
My hometown’s got your face all around</br>
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.</br>

I hope you’re happy now</br>
\- he looks a lot like me.</br>
Even though he only cares</br>
while you are on your knees.</br>
Later on, when you’re looking</br>
at your phone and got no replies,</br>
I’m not the one to call.</br>
You’re just a pretty decoration that catch their eye,</br>
and just like me, they’re all moving on.</br>

Shot down with your heart in your hand.</br>
I don’t understand why you stick around.</br>
Your hometown’s got my face all around.</br>
I really think you know, you’re holding the gun.</br>
